		Ramakrishna Paramahansa was an Indian Hindu mystic and saint in 19th century
		Bengal. He eschewed business and worldly affairs from a early age and
		pursued the Divine throughout his life. He believed in divine
		embodiment of the Supreme Being in all individuals.

	<p class="bio-paragraph-1">Born into poor
		Bengali family Ramakrishna would experience episodes of spiritual
		ecstasy from everyday occurrences starting in his childhood. He would
		go into trances while praying or observing religious dramas. As a
		child he loved to create clay models of Hindu deities and he was
		drawn to folk stories. He became a talented storyteller himself and
		always remained a simple man with an almost childlike quality and
		devotion to love of the Divine and renunciation of worldly gain.

	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>
	</p>
	<p class="bio-paragraph-1">Ramakrishna went on
		to study under gurus and spiritual teachers of diverse schools of
		Hinduism and yoga. He incorporated diverse philosophies into his own,
		always emphasizing that the realization of the existence of the
		Divine is the supreme goal of all living beings. Various religions
		were for him only a means to reach the absolute and he said to have
		went as far as to practice devotion as both a Muslim and a Christian
		for brief periods.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>
	</p>
	<p class="bio-paragraph-1">Ramakrishna's
		influence reached all strata of society and he did not differentiate
		based on caste. He is one of the most celebrated mystics of all time
		and he had a profound effect on many. Among his disciples was Swami
		Vivekananda who became famous in his own right for introducing the West to Hindu
		philosophy, yoga and the teachings of his guru Sri Ramakrishna.
